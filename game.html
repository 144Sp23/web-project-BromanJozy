            <p id="gameTxt">Naughty Dog released The Last of Us in 2013. It was a massive success, hugely owing to the motion-capture and acting performances from Troy Baker, playing Joel, and Dakota Johnson, playing Ellie. There's no doubt that the other aspects of the game were extremely polished and life-like, adding to the immersion, but the cherry on top that earned the game so many masterpiece-proclamations were the acting performances and writing. In fact, there are many, many scenes in the show that followed in-game cutscenes almost exactly. HBO's adaptation of the game is essentially the very first hugely successful video-game adaptation that stays true to the source material. Fun fact: Troy Baker and Dakota Johnson were both in the show as one-off characters!
