            <p id="joelTxt">Pedro Pascal plays one of the co-lead roles of Joel. He did a great job along with Bella Ramsay as Ellie. In my opinion, on par with Troy Baker's performance in the original game. Joel is tasked with smuggling Ellie through a post-apocalyptic world that includes the equivalent of zombies. As they go through their journey, they can't help but become friends, and Joel must face his fear of growing close to people. Similar in many ways to his role in The Mandolorian, he plays a hardened man apprehensive to let his hopes up or his emotions show. As he begins to bond with this young person who's also in need of others, they can't help but form something akin to a caring relationship despite Joel's intentions. Without spoiling anything, Pedro's performance of a pragmatic man forced to care was incredibly moving.
