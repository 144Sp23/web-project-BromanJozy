            <p id="ellieTxt">Bella Ramsay plays the co-lead role of Ellie. Bella also did a great job as Ellie. She delivered a performance just as well as Pedro, and made a great duo. She and Joel need to go west and so they do, with Ellie's sarcasm and puns to whittle away at Joel's pragmatism and cynicism. Their journey is as much about character development as distance travelled, and Ellie is the main instigator of this. She can't help but try to communicate out of boredom if nothing else. The same way she grows closer to Joel, she also learns from him how to survive and fend for herself in the post-apocalyptic world.
